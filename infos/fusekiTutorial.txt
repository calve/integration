How to set up a Fuseki server and load your data into it using TDB

(0) Download and install jena-fuseki, see
http://jena.apache.org/documentation/serving_data/

(1) Create a directory where your persistent TDB database will go

  mkdir MYTDB

(2) Start the fuseki server with (a) update enabled so we can add data
to it; (b) the TDB data directory location; and (c) the dataset name
ds.

  fuseki-server --update --loc=/MTYDB /ds

(3) add data with the s-put script from a file containing RDF in one
of the standard formats.

  s-put http://localhost:3030/ds/data default Data/books.ttl

The s-put args are (a) the URI that gives the server location and port
(3030 is the default for fuseki) the database name we used when we
created the server (ds for our example) and the string 'data', which
is required when we are adding data; (b) the named graph we want the
data to be placed into, where 'default' is the default one; (c) a file
path to the file containing the RDF data.

(3a) If you have a lot of data, it's much faster to use tdbloader to
create the tdbdatabase and load the data into it.  Putting the data in
.nt format should be somewhat faster, e.g., 50K triples/sec). You can
use rdf2rdf to convert your RDF data to ntriples

  tdbloader --loc:MYDB postten.nt

(4) You can query the server via s-get, the control panel or whatever.
For example, sthe following URL retrieves five triples in xml/rdf.

  http://localhost:3030/ds/query?query=SELECT%20*%20%7B%3Fs%20%3Fp%20%3Fo%7D%20limit%205
